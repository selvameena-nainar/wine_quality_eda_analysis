# Wine Quality Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Wine Quality dataset using Python.  
The goal is to understand how various physicochemical properties influence wine quality by visualizing the data and extracting key insights.

## Dataset Description
-**Dataset Name:** Wine Quality Dataset  
- **Source:** (UCI Machine Learning Repository)  
- **Data Type:** CSV  
- **Total Features:** e.g., 12 physicochemical attributes + quality score  
- **Files Included:**
  - `winequality.csv` – dataset  
  - `Wine_Quality_EDA.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook  
  - `Project_Report.docx` – summary document


## Methodology
The project performs the following steps:
1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
2. **Data Cleaning & Pre-processing**
3. **Univariate & Bivariate Analysis**
4. **Correlation Analysis**
5. **Visualizations & Insights**
6. **Summary of Observations**


## Libraries & Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn


## Results Summary
This EDA provides clear insights into the patterns and relationships in the Wine Quality dataset. Key findings include:
- Feature Alcohol has a positive correlation with quality
- Feature volatile acidity shows little impact
- Observational trends (e.g., distribution trends, outliers)
